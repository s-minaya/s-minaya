# Hi there, I'm Sofía Minaya👋

### Junior Full Stack Web Developer · ex‑Hospitality & Administrative Professional · Lifelong Problem Solver

I spent 10 years in hotel reception and administration learning to stay calm under pressure, prioritise when everything feels urgent, and find practical solutions at lightning speed. Then I decided to apply all of that to something I'm genuinely passionate about — **building things for the web**.

I recently completed my full stack training at **Adalab Bootcamp** and I'm currently looking for my first dev role where I can keep growing, contribute, and bring my own creative touch to every project.

## 🌱 What I bring beyond the code

- 🏨 **Resilience built in the real world** — 10 years handling high-pressure environments with a smile
- 🎨 **An eye for design** — I create my own logos, icons and custom visuals for my projects
- 🧩 **A problem-solver mindset** — if something breaks, I don't panic. I debug.
- 🤝 **Team player** — Scrum and Agile aren't just buzzwords to me, I've lived them in project sprints
